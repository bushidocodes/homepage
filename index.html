    <p>
      Hey I'm Sean. I live in California and I hella like computers and Star
      Wars. I play Star Wars CCG because my mom said that Magic cards were
      Satanic. I really don't know about all that, but I have a black-border
      Darth Vader card and I won a tournament at Spidey Sportcards and Comics
      recently, so I think it all worked out okay.

    <h2>Gamesss....</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite games in no particular order. If you have a 707 area code and
      want to play a dial up game, message me on AIM. My screen name is mcbkbsh,
      but I share this with my family, so ask me a Star Wars trivia question to
      make sure you're really talking to me. If you go to school with me, I can
      do Pokemon battles too. I've got the Red one.
